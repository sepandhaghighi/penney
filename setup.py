MINIMAL_DESCRIPTION = '''
Penney's game, named after its inventor Walter Penney, is a binary (head/tail) sequence generating game between two or more players.
Player A selects a sequence of heads and tails (of length 3 or larger), and shows this sequence to player B. Player B then
selects another sequence of heads and tails of the same length. Subsequently, a fair coin is tossed until either player A's
or player B's sequence appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin toss outcomes. The player whose sequence appears first wins.
